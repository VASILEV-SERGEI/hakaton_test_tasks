**Technical task:**

Please provide an analysis that identifies what traits, characteristics, patterns, etc. can be used to indicate a higher probability of a positive/ideal outcome and please describe your methodology.


**Data description:**

We have at our disposal a dataset in which the data was obtained through parsing, so the data is not pure and we will take this fact into account when describing the data.
